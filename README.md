# Warehouse

A simple boiler-plate for web apps.

## Features

* Simple layout. No frameworks. Little abstraction.

* Modular (Easy to swap out logger, router, and middleware.)

* Tries to adhere to the 12 factor application paradigm.

* TLS Enabled. (Make sure to generate your key and cert.)

## Getting started

_Binary will only run on non-Windows systems, it's best if you use `MacOS`, `BSD`, or `Linux` for development and deployment._
